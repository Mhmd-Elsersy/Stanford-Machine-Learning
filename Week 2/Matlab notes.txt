Some Mathematical functions in Matlab:
exp(b)  ln(b)  log10(b)   log2(b)  sqrt(b)   nthroot(b, n)   


Matlab mathematical functions can act on scalars as well as vectors and matrices.


In matlab, a vector that has a single row is called a row vecotr and a vector
that has a single column is called a column vecotr. Row vector is entered like
this vRow = [3, 2, 5, 4] and column vector is entered like this [3; 4; 3; 2]


In matlab index of a vector is starts with 1,2,....,n. We can add elements to
a vector like this v(6) = 5 if the vector has already 5 elements.


To apply power to vectors use v.^n like v.^2


To transform a RowVector to a columnVector and vise versa, use c = V';
the resul is stored in a new variable, and the original vector is not changed.


To create a sequence of N equally-spaced points use for example v = 2:0.2:3
the start is 2 the end is 3 and the step is 0.2. The output is a vector conatianing
the points.


To create a sequence of spaced specified points use e.g. v = linespace(0, 3, 8)
the start is 0, the end is 3, and the number of points is 8.


to make a plot of two coordinates e.g. v1 and v2 are two vectors. To plot them
use plot(x, y). You can specifiy the style of the line in the plot through 
adding plot(x, y, 'm:s'). There are other styles like 'g--*' and 'x-'


To add labels to out axes use: xlabel('x')  ylabel('y'). To add title use
title('my plot') and to add legend use legend('y(t)').


To create a matrix in matlab use [1st row; 2nd row; 3rd row].


To extract an element of a matrix use M(3, 2). To extract multiple elements, use
M9[2, 3], 2) to output the the 2nd and 3rd elements of the 2nd column.To extract
many elements of a single column, use M(2:4, 2). To extract the entire column
use M(:, 2).


To get the length of a vector, use L1 = length(u). To get the dimensions of a 
matrix, use S1 = size(M)


We concatenate scalars like [1, 2, 3] horizontally or [1; 5; 3] vertically in 
the form of a vector. In the same manner, we can concatenate matrices horizontally
C = [A, B], and vertically C = [A; B]. But be carful with the dimensions.


To perform matrix multiplication use A*B.


Use & as AND operation, | as OR operation, and ~ as NOT operation. Not equal in
matlab is ~=. The rest is the same as programming languages.


To apply relational operations to vectors e.g. I = v < 0.005, to test the elements
against 0.005. This returns a vector of 1's corresponding to the values > 0.005
and 0's otherwise, then you can write r = v(I) to get these values easily.
